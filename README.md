## INTRODUCTION
The Python code is based on an original implementation in MATLAB, translated using various Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, JAX etc.)
It provided calculates loudness according to the model described by Moore et 
al. (2016), but with the modified time constants described by Moore et al. (2018). It was
developed from C code for the same model, and Matlab code written for ANSI S3.4-2007,
based on Moore et al. (1997) and Glasberg and Moore (2006) and ISO 532-2 (2017), 
based on Moore and Glasberg (2007). The source code is provided free for any research purposes.
